# Life

This application is designed to collect, store, and display random data that
I have entrusted to various services over the years, and serve as sort of
"Life dashboard".

Initially it will only be collecting and indexing data from Foursquare and Instagram,
however it will eventually also include things like Twitter, DayOne, Apple
HealthKit, and RescueTime.
